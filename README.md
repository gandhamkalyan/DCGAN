Introduction
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning frameworks designed by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014. GANs consist of two neural networks, the generator and the discriminator, which compete against each other in a zero-sum game framework. DCGANs are a specific type of GAN that utilize convolutional and convolutional-transpose layers without max pooling or fully connected layers.

In this project, we leverage DCGANs to generate images of numbers. The generator creates new images from random noise, while the discriminator evaluates their authenticity.

Architecture
Generator
The generator's role is to take random noise as input and transform it into realistic images of numbers. It uses a series of convolutional transpose layers (also known as deconvolutional layers) to upsample the noise vector into an image. The key layers include:

Dense Layer: Fully connected layer to reshape the noise vector.
Batch Normalization: Helps stabilize and accelerate training.
ReLU Activation: Introduces non-linearity.
Conv2DTranspose Layers: Upsamples the input to the desired image size.
Tanh Activation: Normalizes the output image pixels to the range [-1, 1].
Discriminator
The discriminator's role is to distinguish between real images (from the dataset) and fake images (produced by the generator). It uses a series of convolutional layers to downsample the image and output a probability score. The key layers include:

Conv2D Layers: Downsamples the input image.
Batch Normalization: Helps stabilize and accelerate training.
LeakyReLU Activation: Allows a small gradient when the unit is not active.
Dense Layer: Fully connected layer to output the final probability score.
Sigmoid Activation: Outputs a probability score between 0 and 1.
Training Process
The training process involves alternating between training the discriminator and the generator:

Train Discriminator:

Real images from the dataset are labeled as real.
Fake images from the generator are labeled as fake.
The discriminator is trained to maximize the probability of assigning the correct label to both real and fake images.
Train Generator:

Generate a batch of fake images.
Use the discriminator to predict the probability of these images being real.
The generator is trained to minimize the probability of the discriminator correctly identifying the fake images.
The goal is for the generator to produce images indistinguishable from real ones, while the discriminator becomes better at identifying real versus fake images.

Results
After sufficient training, the generator produces images that closely resemble the numbers from the training dataset. The discriminator's accuracy in distinguishing real from fake images stabilizes, indicating a balanced adversarial training process.
